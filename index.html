        <p> <span style="color:#046380">Record of success.</span> I'm Juli Claussen &mdash; owner of Search &amp; Genealogy Services and lead genealogist. <span style="color:#046380">I have a long history of successful searches – 95% of the time, I find the person.</span>
This is my calling – I love this work and that means I want to do excellent work. It is my genuine desire to help people that has led me to become a search professional. It gives me great joy to see family members reunited and to finally have closure after what may have been years of searching.

        <p>We have a specialization and special interest in adoption searches. My work as both a social and genealogist makes me uniquely qualified in working with the area of adoption. I was trained under the late Edward "Mike" Egan &mdash; the premier Illinois adoption search professional.</p>    
        
        <p>Since 2000, I have been reuniting adoptees, birth mothers, siblings, birth fathers, researching absent fathers and anyone who has been separated by adoption or other family separations. It is my privilege to help re-connect those separated by adoption. I have a very high success rate. In my experience, most people in adoption searches want to be found.<span style="color:#046380"> I will go above and beyond to solve the mysteries, and will do so with empathy and respect.</span></p>    
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Adoption traid.</span>Every member of the adoption triad is represented on my team. Adoption triad &mdash; the three-sided relationship that exists in an adoption between birth parents, adoptive parents and the adoptee, each of which is interconnected on the others. An understanding of the complicated dynamics between each member of the adoption triad is essential for an adoption search professional. My background as a social worker, my own family’s experiences related to adoptions, and my many years assisting with searches and reunions equips me for this work.</p>

        <p>We often find people after private investigators have failed. We can map out the family of the deceased, identify the heirs and locate surviving family members, and provide detailed heirship reports. Your first search is offered at <span style="color:#046380">No Find – No Fee.</span> We work quickly and in most cases find mineral owners and/or heirs within a week; sometimes the very next day. I keep you informed each step of the way so that you can decide how much time and money to invest and our rates are affordable. </p>
    
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Missing Heirs.</span> We find find missing heirs or next of kin. We assist heir-search companies, attorneys, estate administrators, banks and medical examiner offices. We have successfully traced all living heirs of individuals who have died in the mid-1800s. </p>
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Mineral Owners.</span> If you are a landman or running title, we can help you. We can track royalty, mineral and interest owners from patent date forward. No more “address unknown” for your pooling hearings. We’ve located living mineral and land owners missing since 1930.

    <div class="companytext">Our Company</div>  
    <p>An award-winning small business &mdash; our research group consists of a close group of highly experienced professional genealogists. Search &amp; Genealogy Services specializes primarily in adoption searches and missing heirs searches. Among the working genealogists are myself, Jayme Federick, and Andrea Avery. </p>
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Juli Claussen &mdash; Professional Genealogist and CEO.</span> I have 35 years of experience in genealogical research and 15 years working with the oil and gas industry and locating missing heirs for attorneys and other professionals. I volunteer my services in a number of ways: finding families of terminally ill patients, researching police officers killed in the line of duty long ago for nomination to state and national memorials, and reuniting families for those who are low income.</p> 
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Jayme Federick &mdash; Professional Genealogist. </span> Jaymie has been involved in helping reunite families separated by adoption since 1994 when she searched for and found the son she had relinquished in 1975. She has trained under some of the top adoption researchers in the USA. Using her experience from a career in law enforcement she found that putting together the puzzle pieces that led to the location of missing people came rather easy.</p>    
        
        <p><span style="color:#046380">Andrea Avery &mdash; Professional Genealogist. </span> A genealogist for over 40 years, Andrea began her personal genealogy journey as a preteen with her grandmother. As a 6th generation Texan and West Texas native and resident, it was a logical step to use her genealogy skills in the oil business as a petroleum landman. Later, when she relocated to the Austin, Texas area, she became a professional genealogist. These two careers complimented each other. Petroleum land work taught her about land research and probate, which are so helpful in genealogy research; and genealogy taught her how to follow documentary trails in mineral owner research.</p>

        <b>Testimonials...</b><br><br>
        “From the daughter of an elderly adoptee, whose biological sister was located despite a very challenging search: “We are very grateful that you had the knowledge and skill needed to access the right resources and quickly locate Dad’s sister. Otherwise our search would have taken years instead of a few months, and she may never have been found.” <br> &mdash; Jonathan T.<br><br>
        “What a blessing your research has been!  Thanks for your kind spirit, resourcefulness and professionalism!  In gratitude…”<br>&mdash;James Simmons, Monmouth, OR

<div class="gallerytext">Juli's Beliefs &amp; Family Gallery</div>
    
    <blockquote>Everyone has the<span style="color:#046380"> right</span> to information about their family members and who they are.  This includes medical history, ethnic background, etc.

        Secrecy implies shame. An adoption in the family is nothing to be ashamed of.  I believe in<span style="color:#046380"> openness</span> in adoption.

        Adoptees have the right to have<span style="color:#046380"> answers</span> to their questions, know the first chapter of their story and understand why they were placed for adoption.

        Birth mothers and fathers have the right to know what became of the child they gave up. They have questions they would like answered too.<span style="color:#046380"> (Juli Claussen)</span></blockquote><br>
